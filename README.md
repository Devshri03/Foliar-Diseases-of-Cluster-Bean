# Cluster-bean-leaf-diseases
# Abstract
Cluster bean is a valuable crop and widely grown bean in many countries due to its significant culinary, industrial, and health benefits. It is primarily used in guar gum production, which is vital in various industries, supporting economic growth and sustainable agricultural practices. Given its significance, early and accurate prediction of cluster bean plant leaf diseases is essential for reducing crop losses and improving management. Recently, deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures, have been utilized for creating crop disease detection and classification models, replacing traditional visual disease identification methods. A dataset is one of the most critical elements for disease prediction models. While many public datasets, like PlantVillage, PlantDoc, etc., exist for other crops, none were available specifically for cluster bean plant leaf diseases. We have therefore created a new dataset for "Leaf Diseases of Cluster Bean Plant." This dataset includes images collected from Gwalior and the surrounding region of Madhya Pradesh, India. The dataset encompasses a total number of 9249 images of cluster bean plants about thirteen different diseases such as Alternaria, Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, and others. To enhance the model's generalizability, the dataset incorporates images captured under various environmental conditions, including different lighting, angles, and stages of leaf damage (half-leaf, texture changes, and color changes). We have performance a meta-analysis of various CNN-based deep learning models to this dataset, and the baseline results are being established. The "Diseases of Cluster Bean" dataset will be available at https://github.com/Devshri03/Foliar Diseases of Cluster Bean.
# Importance 
Agriculture is rapidly advancing through the use of deep learning, which aids in the early detection of plant leaf diseases and ultimately increases the income of small farmers. Cluster beans are one of the most widely cultivated beans globally, with applications in medicine, health, cosmetics, mining, paper making, food production, and more. Researchers have developed CNN architecture-based deep learning models to automate the detection and classification of diseases in cluster bean leaves. However, a major challenge is the lack of real-world datasets. Many available datasets, such as PlantVillage, are created in controlled laboratory environments, featuring single leaves per image with a fixed background. Real-world conditions, with their diverse backgrounds, lighting, textures, colors, and partial images, complicate the identification of leaf diseases.
# Problem Statement
The "Diseases of Cluster Bean" dataset addresses these challenges, aiding farmers in identifying leaf diseases more effectively. In the fields of Gwalior and nearby districts in Madhya Pradesh, Bharat, we identified several diseases, including Alternaria, Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, Bacterial Brown Spot, Common Bacterial, Cercospora, Leaf Curl, Healthy Leaves, Insect Damage, Powdery Mildew, Rust, Septoria Brown Spot, and Yellow Mosaic Virus. Currently, no datasets exist for these specific conditions.
# contribution
Our significant contribution is the creation of the "Diseases of Cluster Bean" dataset, the first publicly available dataset for cluster bean plants. This dataset is crucial for farmers to identify various diseases such as Alternaria, Anthracnose, Bacterial Blight, Bacterial Brown Spot, Common Bacterial, Cercospora, Leaf Curl, Healthy Leaves, Insect Damage, Powdery Mildew, Rust, Septoria Brown Spot, and Yellow Mosaic Virus. The dataset aims to enhance bean production, stimulate the economy, and increase farmer income. Future work could involve adding root diseases to the dataset and developing new classification models to improve accuracy.
